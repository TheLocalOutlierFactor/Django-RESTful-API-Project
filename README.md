# **Django RESTful Store API**


## **Introduction**

This is a personal portfolio project with the purpose to study new technologies/frameworks and demonstrate the ability to use them in the environment of backend development.

The project is an imitation of a RESTful API for an online store.

Technologies that are currently implemented in this project:
- git (*duh!*)
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
- PostgreSQL
- Swagger
- Celery
- Redis

## **TODO List**

- Add unit tests
- Add async support
- Dockerize the app
- Maybe more stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
